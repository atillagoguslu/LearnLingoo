## ‚ú® Overview

LearnLingo is a modern Vite + React single‚Äëpage app that helps learners discover language tutors, explore detailed profiles and reviews, and book a trial lesson. Authentication is powered by Firebase. Forms are built with react‚Äëhook‚Äëform and validated with Yup. Favorites are persisted per user in Firebase and survive page refreshes.

## üöÄ Live-ready Highlights

- ‚úÖ Three pages: `Home`, `Teachers`, `Favorites`
- üîê Auth with Firebase: registration, login, logout (modals)
- üß† Strong form UX: react-hook-form + Yup, all fields required
- üóÇÔ∏è Teachers list with filters (language, level, price) and server‚Äëaware pagination
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites per authorized user (stored in Firebase), persisted between sessions
- üîç ‚ÄúRead more‚Äù expands rich teacher details with reviews
- üìÖ ‚ÄúBook trial lesson‚Äù opens a validated booking form
- ‚ôø Modal UX: close by cross, backdrop click, or Esc key
- üß≠ Protected routes for `Teachers` and `Favorites`
- ‚ö° Vite dev server, production build ready for Vercel

> Note: In this implementation, `Teachers` and `Favorites` routes are gated behind auth. Unauthorized users attempting to favorite a teacher are prompted appropriately.

- Vite 7
- React 19
- React Router 7 (using `react-router` package)
- Firebase (Auth + Realtime Database)
- react-hook-form + @hookform/resolvers
- Yup validation

## üîé Teachers: Filtering, Pagination, and Data Model

- Displays 4 cards initially; click ‚ÄúLoad more‚Äù to fetch the next page.
- Filters: language, level, exact price per hour.
- Under the hood (`src/db/teachers.js`):
  - Uses Firebase Realtime Database queries.
  - Applies one primary server-side filter (price) where possible.
  - Applies secondary filters (language/level) client-side for robust results.
  - Cursor-based pagination ensures no duplicates between pages.

Expected `teachers` collection shape (flexible; arrays or keyed objects supported):

```json
{
  "teachers": {
    "0": {
      "name": "Jane",
      "surname": "Doe",
      "avatar_url": "https://...",
      "languages": ["english", "spanish"],
      "levels": ["A1 Beginner", "A2 Elementary"],
      "price_per_hour": 20,
      "lessons_done": 122,
      "rating": 4.9,
      "lesson_info": "Personalized 1:1 online lessons",
      "conditions": ["First lesson free"],
      "experience": "5+ years teaching adults",
      "reviews": [
        {
          "reviewer_name": "Alex",
          "reviewer_rating": 5,
          "comment": "Amazing lesson!"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites

- Only authorized users can add/remove favorites.
- Stored at `users/{uid}/favorites` in Firebase Realtime Database.
- UI state syncs live via a subscription; selections persist after refresh.

---

## üîê Authentication & Modals

- Login and registration live in modals.
- Validation via Yup; all fields are required.
- Each modal closes via cross icon, backdrop click, or Esc key.

Session is stored in `localStorage` for quick gating and is synced with Firebase Auth state.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (20+ recommended)
- npm 9+

### 1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2) Configure environment

Create `.env.local` in the project root with your Firebase web API key:

```bash
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY
```

Other Firebase config values are already embedded in `src/db/dbInit.js` for the LearnLingo project. If you fork this app for your own Firebase project, update `authDomain`, `databaseURL`, `projectId`, etc. accordingly.

### 3) Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4) Build and preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Useful scripts

```bash
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to Vercel

1. Push the repository to GitHub/GitLab.
2. Create a new Vercel project and import the repo.
3. Set Environment Variables:
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
4. Build settings:
   - Install Command: `npm ci` (or `npm install`)
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
5. Deploy. Vercel will serve the SPA and fallback routes automatically.

---

## üîí Route Protection

`/teachers` and `/favorites` are protected with a simple authorization wrapper (`src/utilities/pageAuthorization.jsx`). Unauthorized users are redirected to `Home` until they sign in.

---

## üß™ UX & Accessibility Notes

- Keyboard users can close modals with `Esc`.
- Focus order and visual indicators are preserved by default components and styles.
- Images include `alt` text; decorative icons avoid noise.

---

## üß© Design Decisions & Trade‚Äëoffs

- React Router v7 single package (`react-router`) for modern routing.
- Realtime Database querying favors correctness and pagination consistency; secondary filters are applied client‚Äëside for flexibility.
- Favorites live in Firebase (not only localStorage) to keep state consistent across devices and refreshes.
